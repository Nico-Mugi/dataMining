## Difficulty levels 

Every exercise has an associated difficulty level. Easy and
medium-difficult exercises help you understand the fundamentals and give
you ideas to work on difficult exercises. It is highly recommended that
you finish easy and medium-difficult exercises to have a good score.
Given below is the difficulty scale that will be marked with every
exercise:

1.  ★: Easy
2.  ★★: Medium
3.  ★★★: Difficult

### Guidelines

1.  To get complete guidance from the mentors, it is highly recommended
    that you work on today\'s practical session and not on the preceding
    ones.
2.  There are several ways to achieve a task. Hence there are many
    possible solutions. But try to make maximum use of the libraries
    that have been suggested to you for your exercises.
